# Tic-Tac-Toe-Bot
This is invincible Tit-Tac-Toe bot. You can play in 1 or 2 players, running the executable with ./Tic-Tac-Toe-Bot. If you play in 1 player mode,
you will play against the unbeatable bot, so go for the tie. This file would need to be refactored and the UI can be improved upon, but this is 
a working, unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe bot.
